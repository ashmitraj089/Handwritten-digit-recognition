# Handwritten-digit-recognition
<p>This is a classification model which is used to recognize handwritten digits from 0-9.</p>
<p>To implement this classification model I have used Neural Networks and to implement neural networks I have used keras in backend.<p>
<P>For dataset , MNIST dataset has been used ,which comes with keras. This dataset contain total 70000 images of handwritten digits, where each image is 28 x 28 pixels. Out of this 70000 images , 60000 images belongs to training set and the remaining 10000 belongs to test set. I have further splitted the training set in two parts, training set and validation set, where training set gets 83% whereas the validation set gets 13% out of 60000 images.</p>
